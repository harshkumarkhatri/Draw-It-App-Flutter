# draw_it_app

A new Flutter project.
added the fdrawing with multi color feature
I have tried asimpl_permission in the app but it is giving some permission error in that.
Due to the same reason i was unable to add image_gallery_saver in the project.
I have now used repaintobject or something like this in one of the del file. i am gettting uint8 list from that and i need to send that to firestorage. I have tried converting it to image/base64 but failed.

to be done:-
* Saving the canvas and clearing the screen
* deleting the lines which we have drawn.
* adding a background image on which drawing can be done and then saving it.
* adding some text on the image.
