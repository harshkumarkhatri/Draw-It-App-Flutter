## Introduction 📌

Students often tend to find something like a pen or papaer to write important thing down which they remember all of a suddent. They may type it down it on some note editor or in some chat but they often missout the feel which they get.

With this app, i tend to provide students a place where they can write down their notes or bits which they remember all of a sudden but they don't have a pen or a paper available to pen it down. Also it would provide children with a canvas to draw things out and show their creativity.

## Technology Stack 🏁

- [Flutter Web](https://flutter.dev/web)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Why this Project? 🏃‍♂️

My main goal behind creating this project was to provide people(maily students) with a canvas where they can pen their idea when they get one all of a sudden and save it down to either cloud or local storage and have a look at the same later on. The feel which the app has while penning things down is somethings which makes you remember that you have drawn something which you can go and have a look at later.

The interface of the app is simple yet elegant which makes it begineer friendly as well.

For this project, i have worked on various domains like:

- UI/UX Development with Flutter 
- Data Storage with Firebase Firestore
- User authentication with Firebase
- Image storage with Firebase storage & with Local Storage
