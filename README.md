# draw_it_app

A new Flutter project.
to be done:-
* Saving the canvas and clearing the screen---done
* deleting the lines which we have drawn--- ased an erase option.
* adding a background image on which drawing can be done and then saving it.
* adding some text on the image---not doing this for now.
* make the drawing screen with the app bar so that some details can be added in the appbar----Done with a stack
* adding double back to close the app--- this is not being done as we are having a snackbar pre present in the bottom and it will not appear again
* saving to the device is working fine. i need to add a ticker which can be used to save the photos to the gallery or to the cloud.Was working on this look for how we can save the state of the variable defined in the del_variable and changed with the ticker.---added an option in the top 3 dots which can be used to switch between the saving state.
* the only pro3blem which is coming now is that the screen is not refreshed after th image is save to gallery whereas when the image is saved to cloud things are fine.---Added it to FAQ.

* Adding the login and signup if the user wished to save to the cloud. This condition of login should be satisfied first. Also once the login is made then the app saves the login and it should not be done each time the app is closed. 
* Saving images to storage in a particular folder.
* Saving images to cloud in the folder which is unique and identified with their username/email.
* A way with whcih the images which are displayed from the cloud can be opened in the gallery.
* A waythrough which we can display all the images from the cloud and from storage to the user in another screen.
* Add a screen to display all the images which are saved in the cloud
